# TicTacToe Game
Written on React/Redux.

<h2>Todos:</h2>
- Update layout of <Playground> to support random field size, not 3 only. (Use css grid and flex.)
- Improve Thunk usage into gameSlice — read https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/advanced-tutorial#thinking-in-thunks
- Update logic of processMove invoking — now reducers are been calling even after a game finishes.
- Write some tests with Redux Toolkit!
- Try to use Saga instead of Thunk.
