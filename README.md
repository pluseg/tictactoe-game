1. ~Update layout of <Playground> to support random field size, not 3 only. (Use css grid and flex.)~
2. ~Improve Thunk usage into gameSlice — read https://redux-toolkit.js.org/tutorials/advanced-tutorial#thinking-in-thunks~

4. Write some tests with Redux Toolkit!
5. Try to use Saga instead of Thunk.
